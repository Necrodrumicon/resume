    <h1>About me</h1>    
        <p>Well, what can I say, I'm a minimalist, mainly because <cite>"the only things in life of worth are free"</cite> and I may have a TOC. Also it is said that <cite>"you are what you do"</cite>, so It could be said that I'm a programmer (I'm a logical person), a pianist (I love jazz!) and a reader (I love my kindle!).</p>
        <p>Furthermore I enjoy the outdoor living, specially going out for a running and when on holidays, trekking alone.</p>
